This repository contains the code and documentation for the **Trajectory Tracking Control of an Anthropomorphic Robotic Arm** project. The project showcases the integration of control theory, specifically a Proportional-Derivative (PD) controller, to achieve accurate trajectory tracking for a robotic arm. The simulation visualizes the arm's performance in tracking complex trajectories under varying conditions.

## **Motivation**

During my graduate studies at Arizona State University, I sought to bridge the gap between abstract control theory and real-world applications. My undergraduate projects had given me a strong foundation in control theory, but I wanted to tackle challenges with tangible, practical relevance. To achieve this, I enrolled in the course Modeling and Control of Robots, which provided the ideal platform for applying control systems to robotics.

I set out to develop a trajectory control system for a 3-DOF robotic armâ€”a task demanding precise kinematics, dynamic modeling, and control system design. While many peers stopped at basic kinematics, I designed a complete system, including forward and inverse kinematics, dynamics analysis, and a PD controller. The project culminated in real-time simulations, earning peer recognition and securing a position at the University of Arizona's Space Robotics Lab.

This project not only honed my skills in control system design and robotics but also instilled my passion for solving complex, real-world problems and to the field of Robotics.

## **Technical Approach**

### **Kinematic Model**
Forward and inverse kinematics were developed to enable precise motion planning:
- **Forward Kinematics**:

    </div>
    
The transformation matrix from joint(i-1) to joint(i) is defined as:

$$
A_{i-1}^i =
\begin{bmatrix}
cos(\theta_i) & -sin(\theta_i)cos(\alpha_{i-1}) & sin(\theta_i)sin(\alpha_{i-1}) & a_{i-1}cos(\theta_i)\\
sin(\theta_i) & cos(\theta_i)cos(\alpha_{i-1}) & -cos(\theta_i)sin(\alpha_{i-1}) & a_{i-1}sin(\theta_i)\\
0 & sin(\alpha_{i-1}) & cos(\alpha_{i-1}) & d_i\\
0 & 0 & 0 & 1
\end{bmatrix}
$$

$$ T_{3}^0 = A_{0}^1 * A_{1}^2 * A_{2}^3$$ 

Upon substituting the corresponding values of the a_i 's, alpha_i's, d_i's, and theta_i's. We get position of the end effector as

$$
P_{3}^0 =
\begin{bmatrix}
cos(\theta_1)(a_2cos(\theta_2) + a_3cos(\theta_2+\theta_3))\\
sin(\theta_1)(a_2cos(\theta_2) + a_3cos(\theta_2+\theta_3))\\
a_1 + a_2sin(\theta_2) + a_3sin(\theta_2+\theta_3))
\end{bmatrix}
$$

- **Inverse Kinematics**:
  The inverse kinematics were derived geometrically, solving for joint angles based on the desired end-effector position. Finding the inverse kinematics is quite challenging and often does not have a unique solution. For the chosen configuration, solving the algebraic equations can be complex and is not recommended. The geometric method is more intuitive and easier to solve. The diagrams below help to find the joint angles for a specific end-effector point in the 3D plane.

### **Control System**
The PD controller ensures smooth and accurate trajectory tracking:
- **Proportional-Derivative Control**:
  A PD controller was designed to track the desired trajectory with high precision. The control law minimizes the error between desired and actual positions while ensuring stability.
  The controller gains were manually tuned by varying kp and kd for all three joints. Although the resulting errors were relatively high, further trial and error could have reduced them. However, since this project focused on the dynamics and control of the robot, it served its purpose. In another project using the same robotic arm, I implemented PSO optimization to achieve an RMSE error as low as 0.004. If you're interested in exploring that project, please visit my [PSO-PD Control Project](https://github.com/adharsh-prasad/Robotics-Portfolio/tree/main/PSO-PD-Control).


- **Performance Testing**:
  Simulation results were validated using MATLAB. The plots under the "Simulation and Results" section below shows the joint angles and velocities over time, highlighting the controller's performance.

### **Dynamic Model**
The robotic arm's dynamics are represented as:

$$
M(q)\ddot{q} + V(q, \dot{q}) + G(q) = \tau
$$

Where:

$$ M(q): \quad \text{Inertia matrix,} $$
$$ V(q, \dot{q})\: \quad \text{Coriolis and centripetal forces,} $$
$$ G(q)\: \quad \text{Gravitational force,} $$
$$ \tau\: \quad \text{Control torque.} $$

This equation forms the basis of the PD control law:

$$
\tau = M(q)(\ddot{q}_d - K_p e - K_d \dot{e}) + V(q, \dot{q}) + G(q)
$$

## **Simulation and Results**

### **Trajectory Tracking**

  <img src="Plots/eof_trajectory_tracking3.jpg" width="450" alt="Trajectory Tracking 3">
</div>

The PD controller achieves trajectory tracking to some extent, with significant tracking errors as shown in the end-effector position tracking plots. The error is predominantly due to the fact there are not fine-tuned enough to achieve minimum error. Again the minimum error was achieved with the PSO parameter tuning, please visit my [PSO-PD Control Project](https://github.com/adharsh-prasad/Robotics-Portfolio/tree/main/PSO-PD-Control).

### **Joint Angle Analysis**

  <img src="Plots/joint_angular_velocities.png" width="450" alt="Joint angle angular velocity tracking">
</div>

The initial tracking errors significantly impact the overall performance of the trajectory tracking. Although the velocity plots indicate that the error eventually approaches zero, the large initial error propagates through the system, adversely affecting joint angle tracking performance. The plot below of the joint angle errors provides additional insights into the previously discussed inference.
